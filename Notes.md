# The AR Tag detection task:
1: We need to find the corners of the AR tag(s).
 - We first need to use a proper thresholding technique to convert this to binary image. 
 - Then we will use the harris corner detection algorithm to find the corners of the AR tag(s).


Task 1: I need to understand hpow these vision things work, like rendering things into a video frame.
