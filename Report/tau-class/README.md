# Tau ~ Version 2.5.0

## Description

Tau is a LaTeX2e document class designed for the creation of professional, well-structured research articles, technical/lab reports, and academic documentation.

The main features of the class include:

* A self-contained structure, where the class file and custom packages are distributed within a single folder for easy setup and portability.
* STIX2 as the primary serif font, providing excellent readability for body text and mathematical content.
* Custom environments for notes, information blocks, and structured content.
* Enhanced code presentation, with custom color schemes for multiple programming languages (e.g., MATLAB, C, C++, TeX).
* Integration of a dedicated translation package that simplifies the translation of selected document elements, allowing automatic adaptation to the document language.
* Compatible with external editors such as TeXstudio (additional setup may be required).
